## Title: Simulations and Analysis of Stochastic Processes

### Overview:
This repository contains code related to the project "Simulations and Analysis of Stochastic Processes." The project explores various aspects of stochastic processes, including simulations, theoretical properties, and practical applications. The main focus is on three key components: standard Brownian motion, geometric Brownian motion, and the Martingale betting strategy in a casino setting.


### Project Parts:

1. **Brownian Motion:**
   - Simulations and analysis of standard Brownian motion.
   - Investigation of theoretical properties and their empirical confirmation through simulation results.

2. **Geometric Brownian Motion:**
   - Study of geometric Brownian motion, including theoretical properties and empirical validation through simulations.
   - Comparison of theoretical and empirical measures for various scenarios.

3. **Bridge Brownian Motion:**
 - Study of bridge Brownian motion, including theoretical properties and empirical validation through simulations.
 - Comparison of theoretical and empirical measures for various scenarios.

4. **Custom Brownian Motion:**
   - Study of a defined Brownian motion, including theoretical properties and empirical validation through simulations.
   - Comparison of theoretical and empirical measures for various scenarios.

5. **Martingale Betting Strategy:**
   - Implementation of the Martingale betting strategy in a casino setting.
   - Simulations to explore properties, distributions, and outcomes for different scenarios.
   - Analysis of the impact on the player's gains and losses.
